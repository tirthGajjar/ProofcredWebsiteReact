            <h2>1. Introduction:</h2>
            <p>
              Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully
              before using the Proofcred.com website (the "Service") operated by Proofcred (â€œus",
              "we", or "our").
            </p>
            <p>
              Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and
              compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who
              access or use the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
              disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h2>2. Subscriptions:</h2>
            <p>
              The Service is billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed
              in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set
              either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you
              select when purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the
              exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Proofcred cancels it. You may cancel
              your Subscription renewal either through by contacting support@proofcred.com or by
              contacting Proofcred customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>
              A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for
              your Subscription. You shall provide Proofcred with accurate and complete billing
              information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a
              valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you
              automatically authorise Proofcred to charge all Subscription fees incurred through
              your account to any such payment instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Proofcred will issue an
              electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain
              deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated
              on the invoice
            </p>
            <br />

            <h2>3. Free Trial:</h2>
            <p>
              ProofCred may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a
              limited period of time ("Free Trial").
            </p>
            <p>
              You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free
              Trial.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will
              not be charged by Proofcred until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the
              Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically
              charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have
              selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              At any time and without notice, Proofcred reserves the right to (i) modify the terms
              and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h2>4. Fee Charges</h2>
            <p>
              Proofcred, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees
              for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of
              the then-current Billing Cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proofcred will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription
              fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change
              becomes effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
              constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
            </p>
            <br />
